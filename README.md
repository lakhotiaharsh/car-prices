Introduction
Predicting car prices is a crucial task in the automotive industry, whether for dealerships, buyers, or sellers. This project utilizes various machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car based on its attributes such as fuel consumption, mileage, model, year, and engine type.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of cars and their corresponding prices. The dataset includes the following features:

Model: The make and model of the car.
  Year: The year the car was manufactured.
  Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
  Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
  Engine Size: The size of the car's engine in liters.
  Horsepower: The power output of the carâ€™s engine.
  Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
  Fuel Consumption: The fuel efficiency of the car (e.g., liters per 100km).
  Car Price: The price of the car (target variable).
  The dataset can be obtained from various sources such as Kaggle, government websites, or proprietary data from car dealerships.


Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

  Python 3.8+
  Pandas
  NumPy
  Scikit-learn
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
  Jupyter Notebook


Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project, as it ensures the data is clean and ready for modeling. The preprocessing steps include:

  Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing values.
  Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables (e.g., model, fuel type) into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
  Feature Scaling: Scaling numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which helps improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
  These steps are implemented in the preprocess.py script.

Model Selection
For this regression task, Lasso Regression is chosen as the primary model. Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term, which penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients. This regularization helps to prevent overfitting and can lead to a more interpretable model by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a simpler model.

The key reasons for selecting Lasso Regression are:

  Feature Selection: Lasso can reduce the complexity of the model by selecting only the most important features, making it easier to interpret.
  Regularization: The L1 regularization term helps to prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.
  Performance: Lasso Regression generally performs well when there are many features, some of which might be irrelevant.
  Model selection and tuning are performed using cross-validation to find the optimal regularization parameter (alpha). The best model is selected based on its performance on the validation set.

The Lasso Regression model can be trained and evaluated using the following steps:

  Model Initialization: Initializing the Lasso Regression model with an initial alpha value.
  Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV to find the best value for alpha.
  Training: Fitting the model to the training data.
  Cross-Validation: Assessing the model's performance using cross-validation to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.


Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset. Key evaluation metrics include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of absolute differences between predicted and actual prices.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of squared differences between predicted and actual prices.
R-squared: The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model
